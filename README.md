✨ What is this?

ChatGPT Stream Rescue is a Chrome extension that automatically restores the last assistant reply in ChatGPT when it gets removed by errors or moderation blocks.

🛠️ How it works

1. When ChatGPT shows an error or moderation block and removes the last assistant reply, the extension recovers and displays it above the error notice.

2. No setup required—just install and forget!

3. Restored reply disappears after you send a new message or reload the page.

🔒 Privacy

1. No data leaves your browser.

2. All recovery happens locally. Nothing is uploaded, logged, or stored externally.

⚠️ Limitations

1. Only the last removed assistant reply can be restored.

2. Restored messages are temporary, they vanish after the next user input or a page refresh.

💡 Why install?

1. Stop losing valuable answers to moderation!

2. Frictionless, automatic, and private rescue of your lost content.
