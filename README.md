ChatGPT Stream Rescue

Instantly restores the last ChatGPT assistant reply lost due to errors or moderation.

✨ What is this?

ChatGPT Stream Rescue is a Chrome extension that automatically restores the last assistant reply in ChatGPT when it gets removed by errors or moderation blocks.

🛠️ How it works

When ChatGPT shows an error or moderation block and removes the last assistant reply, the extension instantly recovers and displays it above the error notice.

No setup required—just install and forget!

Restored reply disappears after you send a new message or reload the page.

🔒 Privacy

No data leaves your browser.

All recovery happens locally—nothing is uploaded, logged, or stored externally.

⚠️ Limitations

Only the last removed assistant reply can be restored.

Restored messages are temporary—they vanish after the next user input or a page refresh.

💡 Why install?

Stop losing valuable answers to glitches or moderation!

Frictionless, automatic, and private rescue of your lost content.

Works on chat.openai.com
 and chatgpt.com
.
